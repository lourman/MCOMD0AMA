# Introduction {-}

## Module Structure {-}

We are going to have 12 weeks of teaching. What we would like at the end of this module is for you to be able to have enough knowledge to be able to understand mathematics so you can easily understand concepts that you will find in your course that you are going to follow.

Mathematics is not just about learning how to solve problems but 

The indicative schedule we are going to follow can be seen in table 0.1. Although we shall try and follow this schedule it all depends on you. If you believe that you need an extra session to describe and master something then we are here to listen. Please tell us and we shall try to change it accordingly.

c<- matrix(c(0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,"Numbers","Algebra - Basics","Algebra - Quadratics and Simultaneous Equations","Geometry and thinking","Graphs and Coordinate Geometry","Probability and Statistics","Polynomials","Logarithms and Exponential","Introduction to Discrete Mathematics","Systems","Summary and Revision, TCA", "Assignment"),ncol=2)
colnames(c) <- c("Session","Indicative Content")

knitr::kable(c,
  caption = 'Indicative Content Schedule.',align = "cc", booktabs = FALSE
)
```

## Assignment {-}

TCA 40% 
The TCA will consist of a series of tasks, each examining one area of mathematics.

The second assessment will be a group report and will consist of individual tasks that would be needed to be placed together to produce an end group report.
