This module will cover material from GCSE to A Level maths, that is relevant and required for any computing course in this University. These pages are comprised of theory and excersises to h This is a sample book written in Markdown. You can use anything that Pandocs Markdown supports, e.g., a math equation \\(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\\). The bookdown package can be installed from CRAN or Github: install.packages(&quot;bookdown&quot;) # or the development version # devtools::install_github(&quot;rstudio/bookdown&quot;) Remember each Rmd file contains one and only one chapter, and a chapter is defined by the first-level heading #. To compile this example to PDF, you need XeLaTeX. You are recommended to install TinyTeX (which includes XeLaTeX): https://yihui.org/tinytex/.

Since the beginning of humanity numbers were used to be able to count. The first evidence found that humans were counting was discovered in 1970 by Peter Beaumont near the Lebombo Mountains. The artifact was a baboon fibula that had 29 straight cuts (see figure 1.1). It is hypothesised that it was used to count the menstrual cycles of women. Thus, it can be said that the first astronomers / mathematicians were women. Figure 1.1: The Lebombo bone 44, 000 BC (top) and the Ishango bone 20, 000 BC (bottom) Numbers were and still are used to advance our civilization, from computing to art and music. From simple counting we have used numbers to calculate and measure. To achieve thought all of these advancements different types of numbers have been used, each having its own usage. 1.1 Types of Number 1.1.1 Number Zero Zero as a mathematical symbol has a turbulence timeline. Although its first appearance was first seen by the Sumerians in Mesopotamia, some 5,000 years ago, it was used very infrequently by the Greeks and nothing has been found about the notion of zero by the Romans. On the other hand it has been seen by the Myans, Hindus, Chinese, but the way we use it today and its notions first appeared in the 20th century. 1.1.2 Natural Numbers (N) One of the oldest and familiar number type are the natural numbers \\(N\\). Natural numbers are used for counting and in arithmetic calculations. These include all whole numbers from 1 to infinity \\(\\infty\\) 1.1.3 Whole Numbers (W) The most common numbers used are for counting and are used in arithmetic calculations. These are whole numbers from 1 to infinity 1.1.4 Integer Numbers (Z) 1.1.5 Rational Numbers (Q) 1.1.6 Irrantional Numbers (R) 1.1.7 Real Numbers (R) 1.1.8 Complex Numbers (C) 1.2 Algebraic Properties In this module we are going to be dealing mostly with real numbers, besides some exceptions. Thus, it would be good to know some of the basic algebraic properties of real numbers. 1.2.1 Closure a + b and ab are real numbers 1.2.2 Commutative We can change the position of the number for multiplication and addition without altering the result. a + b = b + a, ab = ba _Addition_ 24 + 42 + 23 + 55 = 144 can also be written as 42 + 23 + 55 + 24 = 144 or 55 + 42 + 24 + 23 = 144 _Multiplication_ 10 x 24 x 2 = 480 can also be written as 2 x 24 x 10 = 480 or 24 x 2 x 10 = 480 1.2.3 Associative (a+b) + c = a + (b+c), (ab)c = a(bc) 1.2.4 Distributive (a+b)c = ac+bc 1.2.5 Identity a+0 = 0+a = a 1.2.6 Inverse a + (-a) = 0, a(1/a) = 1 1.2.7 Cancelation If a+x=a+y, then x=y 1.2.8 Zero-factor a0 = 0a = 0 1.2.9 Negation -(-a) = a, (-a)b= a(-b) = -(ab), (-a)(-b) = ab 1.3 BIDMAS 1.4 LCM and HCF 1.5 Fractions 1.6 Decimals 1.7 Percentages 1.8 Rounding Numbers 1.9 Standard Form "],["algebra-basics.html", "Session 2 Algebra  Basics 2.1 Powers and roots 2.2 Expanding Brackets 2.3 Factorising 2.4 Manipulating Surds", " Session 2 Algebra  Basics 2.1 Powers and roots 2.2 Expanding Brackets 2.3 Factorising 2.4 Manipulating Surds "],["algebra-quadratics-and-simultaneous-equations.html", "Session 3 Algebra  Quadratics and Simultaneous Equations 3.1 Solving and rearranging Equations 3.2 Factorising quadratics 3.3 Quadratic Formula 3.4 Algebraic Fractions 3.5 Sequences 3.6 Inequalities 3.7 Simultaneous Equations", " Session 3 Algebra  Quadratics and Simultaneous Equations 3.1 Solving and rearranging Equations 3.2 Factorising quadratics 3.3 Quadratic Formula 3.4 Algebraic Fractions 3.5 Sequences 3.6 Inequalities 3.7 Simultaneous Equations "],["geometry-and-thinking.html", "Session 4 Geometry and thinking 4.1 Rules of Geometry 4.2 Parallel lines 4.3 Angles 4.4 Properties of known geometrical shapes 4.5 Circle 4.6 Transformation 4.7 Areas 4.8 Scale Factors", " Session 4 Geometry and thinking 4.1 Rules of Geometry 4.2 Parallel lines 4.3 Angles 4.4 Properties of known geometrical shapes 4.5 Circle 4.6 Transformation 4.7 Areas 4.8 Scale Factors "],["graphs-and-coordinate-geometry.html", "Session 5 Graphs and Coordinate Geometry 5.1 Polynomials", " Session 5 Graphs and Coordinate Geometry 5.1 Polynomials "],["probability-and-statistics.html", "Session 6 Probability and Statistics 6.1 Probability basics 6.2 Counting Outcomes 6.3 Tree Diagrams 6.4 Sets and Venn Diagrams 6.5 Sampling and Data collection 6.6 Mean, Median, Mode and range 6.7 Frequency tables 6.8 Plots", " Session 6 Probability and Statistics 6.1 Probability basics 6.2 Counting Outcomes 6.3 Tree Diagrams 6.4 Sets and Venn Diagrams 6.5 Sampling and Data collection 6.6 Mean, Median, Mode and range 6.7 Frequency tables 6.8 Plots "],["polynomials-1.html", "Session 7 Polynomials", " Session 7 Polynomials "],["logarithms-and-exponentials.html", "Session 8 Logarithms and Exponentials", " Session 8 Logarithms and Exponentials "],["introduction-to-discrete-mathematics.html", "Session 9 Introduction to Discrete mathematics", " Session 9 Introduction to Discrete mathematics "],["references.html", "References", " References "],["intro.html", "Session 10 Introduction", " Session 10 Introduction Welcome to Advance Mathematics Module (MCOMD0AMA).

These pages are comprised of theory and excersises to h You can label chapter and section titles using {#label} after them, e.g., we can reference Chapter 10. If you do not manually label them, there will be automatic labels anyway, e.g., Chapter ??. Figures and tables with captions will be placed in figure and table environments, respectively. par(mar = c(4, 4, .1, .1)) plot(pressure, type = &#39;b&#39;, pch = 19) Figure 10.1: Here is a nice figure! Reference a figure by its code chunk label with the fig: prefix, e.g., see Figure 10.1. Similarly, you can reference tables generated from knitr::kable(), e.g., see Table 10.1. knitr::kable( head(iris, 20), caption = &#39;Here is a nice table!&#39;, booktabs = TRUE ) Table 10.1: Here is a nice table!
