This module will cover material from GCSE to A Level maths, that is relevant and required for any computing course in this University. These pages are comprised of theory and excersises to h This is a sample book written in Markdown. You can use anything that Pandocs Markdown supports, e.g., a math equation \\(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\\). The bookdown package can be installed from CRAN or Github: install.packages(&quot;bookdown&quot;) # or the development version # devtools::install_github(&quot;rstudio/bookdown&quot;) Remember each Rmd file contains one and only one chapter, and a chapter is defined by the first-level heading #. To compile this example to PDF, you need XeLaTeX. You are recommended to install TinyTeX (which includes XeLaTeX): https://yihui.org/tinytex/.

This module will cover material from GCSE to A Level maths, that is relevant and required for any computing course in this University. These pages are comprised of theory and excersises to h You can label chapter and section titles using {#label} after them, e.g., we can reference Chapter 10. If you do not manually label them, there will be automatic labels anyway, e.g., Chapter ??. Figures and tables with captions will be placed in figure and table environments, respectively. par(mar = c(4, 4, .1, .1)) plot(pressure, type = &#39;b&#39;, pch = 19) Figure 10.1: Here is a nice figure! Reference a figure by its code chunk label with the fig: prefix, e.g., see Figure 10.1. Similarly, you can reference tables generated from knitr::kable(), e.g., see Table 10.1. knitr::kable( head(iris, 20), caption = &#39;Here is a nice table!&#39;, booktabs = TRUE ) Table 10.1: Here is a nice table!
